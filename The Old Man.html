<p style="color:gold">I'm Richard Harrison but they call me the Old Man or the appraiser.I've been the co-owner of Gold and Silver since 89'
  I earned my nickname when I was 38 now I'm only 75 and I'm still a gambling man working with my family. Family comes second money comes first in the pawn business and when I'm in charge at the shop. When we first went to Vegas to open our shop we only 5K, me and my family made it through loans and my pro business skills. I've stated before that before that my role in then show is an "old grump",but thanks to that our show has high ratings.</P>
  <P style="color:silver">The shop is filled over 12,000 items in the inventory. Most of our stuff that has been brought in is jewelry so we try negotiating for a lower but "fair" price. I served my country for twenty years but mostly to serve my daughter that ultimately passed away at age 6. I've been married since 1960 to Rhue Harrison I met her at 17 years old at a barn dance.</p>
    <P style="color:gold">I'm old man Harrison and I'm the $5 millon dollar man in my shop.
